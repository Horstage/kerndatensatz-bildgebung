  "description": "This FHIR resource profile specifically characterizes the radiological reading process, including both manual interpretations by radiologists and automated processes such as AI algorithms used for tasks like segmentation. It's important to note that this profile does not detail the procedures involved in image acquisition, which are instead described in the ImagingStudy resource's procedureReference.\nThe foremost goal of this resource is to provide structured, contextual information within the Diagnostic Report. This ensures accurate interpretation of various observations. For instance, it clarifies the application of a specific version of the TNM (Tumor, Node, Metastasis) classification and the targeted entity. This feature is particularly useful in TNM observation resources, aiding in precise interpretation and reporting.\nMoreover, this resource can attribute additional properties to BodyStructures identified during a radiological examination. In a TNM-based assessment, a tumor might be categorized as 'Primary', whereas in a RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) based evaluation, the same lesion (BodyStructure) might be classified as a 'Target' lesion.\nImportantly, this resource is designed for reusability across different Diagnostic Reports. This is essential for ensuring that specific information, which remains constant over time, is modeled accurately. For example, in the context of RECIST evaluations, once a lesion is designated as a 'target' lesion, this classification remains unchanged throughout the patient's treatment course. By reusing the resource for different reports, consistency and accuracy in the modeling of such time-invariant data are maintained.",
